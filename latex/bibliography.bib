  abstract      = {As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

  month         = mar,
  abstract      = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial machine learning task that aims to learn patterns from a set of normal training samples to identify abnormal samples in test data. Most existing AD studies assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same data distribution, but the test data can have large distribution shifts arising in many real-world applications due to different natural variations such as new lighting conditions, object poses, or background appearances, rendering existing AD methods ineffective in such cases. In this paper, we consider the problem of anomaly detection under distribution shift and establish performance benchmarks on four widely-used AD and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization datasets. We demonstrate that simple adaptation of state-of-the-art OOD generalization methods to AD settings fails to work effectively due to the lack of labeled anomaly data. We further introduce a novel robust AD approach to diverse distribution shifts by minimizing the distribution gap between in-distribution and OOD normal samples in both the training and inference stages in an unsupervised way. Our extensive empirical results on the four datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art AD methods and OOD generalization methods on data with various distribution shifts, while maintaining the detection accuracy on in-distribution data.

  abstract      = {The correct use of model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection techniques is vital in academic machine learning research as well as in many industrial settings. This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F-test 5x2 cross-validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

  abstract      = {The all-relevant problem of feature selection is the identification of all strongly and weakly relevant attributes. This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

To this end we first examine two recently proposed all relevant feature selection algorithms, both being a random forest wrappers, on a series of synthetic data sets with varying size. We show that reasonable accuracy of predictions can be achieved and that heuristic algorithms that were designed to handle the all relevant problem, have performance that is close to that of the reference ideal algorithm. Then, we apply one of the algorithms to four families of semi-synthetic data sets to assess how the properties of particular data set influence results of feature selection. Finally we test the procedure using a well-known gene expression data set. The relevance of nearly all previously established important genes was confirmed, moreover the relevance of several new ones is discovered.},

  abstract      = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been an important research field for a long time. Seminal work on anomaly detection methods has been focussing on statistical approaches. In recent years an increasing number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies on time-series. Subsequently, researchers tried to improve these techniques using (deep) neural networks. In the light of the increasing number of anomaly detection methods, the body of research lacks a broad comparative evaluation of statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods. This paper studies 20 univariate anomaly detection methods from the all three categories. The evaluation is conducted on publicly available datasets, which serve as benchmarks for time-series anomaly detection. By analyzing the accuracy of each method as well as the computation time of the algorithms, we provide a thorough insight about the performance of these anomaly detection approaches, alongside some general notion of which method is suited for a certain type of data.},

  abstract      = {Anomaly detection is a challenging task that frequently arises in practically all areas of industry and science, from fraud detection and data quality monitoring to finding rare cases of diseases and searching for new physics. Most of the conventional approaches to anomaly detection, such as one-class SVM and Robust Auto-Encoder, are one-class classification methods, i.e. focus on separating normal data from the rest of the space. Such methods are based on the assumption of separability of normal and anomalous classes, and subsequently do not take into account any available samples of anomalies. Nonetheless, in practical settings, some anomalous samples are often available; however, usually in amounts far lower than required for a balanced classification task, and the separability assumption might not always hold. This leads to an important task -- incorporating known anomalous samples into training procedures of anomaly detection models. In this work, we propose a novel model-agnostic training procedure to address this task. We reformulate one-class classification as a binary classification problem with normal data being distinguished from pseudo-anomalous samples. The pseudo-anomalous samples are drawn from low-density regions of a normalizing flow model by feeding tails of the latent distribution into the model. Such an approach allows to easily include known anomalies into the training process of an arbitrary classifier. We demonstrate that our approach shows comparable performance on one-class problems, and, most importantly, achieves comparable or superior results on tasks with variable amounts of known anomalies.},

The resulting Hybrid Isolation Forest (HIF) that we propose is first evaluated on a synthetic dataset to analyze the effect of the new meta-parameters that are introduced and verify that the addressed limitation of the IF algorithm is effectively overcame. We hen compare the two algorithms on the ISCX benchmark dataset, in the context of a network intrusion detection application.

  abstract      = {The ability to detect anomalies in time series is considered highly valuable in numerous application domains. The sequential nature of time series objects is responsible for an additional feature complexity, ultimately requiring specialized approaches in order to solve the task. Essential characteristics of time series, situated outside the time domain, are often difficult to capture with state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when no transformations have been applied to the time series. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods in computer vision, several studies have proposed transforming time series into image-like representations, used as inputs for deep learning models, and have led to very promising results in classification tasks. In this paper, we first review the signal to image encoding approaches found in the literature. Second, we propose modifications to some of their original formulations to make them more robust to the variability in large datasets. Third, we compare them on the basis of a common unsupervised task to demonstrate how the choice of the encoding can impact the results when used in the same deep learning architecture. We thus provide a comparison between six encoding algorithms with and without the proposed modifications. The selected encoding methods are Gramian Angular Field, Markov Transition Field, recurrence plot, grey scale encoding, spectrogram, and scalogram. We also compare the results achieved with the raw signal used as input for another deep learning model. We demonstrate that some encodings have a competitive advantage and might be worth considering within a deep learning framework. The comparison is performed on a dataset collected and released by Airbus SAS, containing highly complex vibration measurements from real helicopter flight tests. The different encodings provide competitive results for anomaly detection.},

  abstract      = {Time series anomaly detection is an important task, with applications in a broad variety of domains. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years, but often they require that the length of the anomalies be known in advance and provided as an input parameter. This limits the practicality of the algorithms, as such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different lengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a linear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been proposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still requires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization step. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method utilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter values for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a set of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based approaches with different criteria for selection of parameter values. We also show that the proposed approach can achieve performance similar to that of the state-of-the-art distance-based anomaly detection algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers, amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data, owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data. To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning. In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision, Recall, and F-measure in each case.},

  abstract      = {Inspired by recent successes of deep learning in computer vision, we propose a novel framework for encoding time series as different types of images, namely, Gramian Angular Summation/Difference Fields (GASF/GADF) and Markov Transition Fields (MTF). This enables the use of techniques from computer vision for time series classification and imputation. We used Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks (tiled CNNs) on 20 standard datasets to learn high-level features from the individual and compound GASF-GADF-MTF images. Our approaches achieve highly competitive results when compared to nine of the current best time series classification approaches. Inspired by the bijection property of GASF on 0/1 rescaled data, we train Denoised Auto-encoders (DA) on the GASF images of four standard and one synthesized compound dataset. The imputation MSE on test data is reduced by 12.18%-48.02% when compared to using the raw data. An analysis of the features and weights learned via tiled CNNs and DAs explains why the approaches work.},

Since estimating the covariance matrix is the cornerstone of many multivariate statistical methods, the MCD is an important building block when developing robust multivariate techniques. It also serves as a convenient and efficient tool for outlier detection. The MCD estimator is reviewed, along with its main properties such as affine equivariance, breakdown value, and influence function. We discuss its computation, and list applications and extensions of the MCD in applied and methodological multivariate statistics. Two recent extensions of the MCD are described. The first one is a fast deterministic algorithm which inherits the robustness of the MCD while being almost affine equivariant. The second is tailored to high-dimensional data, possibly with more dimensions than cases, and incorporates regularization to prevent singular matrices.},

  abstract      = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) conduct image classification by activating dominant features that correlated with labels. When the training and testing data are under similar distributions, their dominant features are similar, which usually facilitates decent performance on the testing data. The performance is nonetheless unmet when tested on samples from different distributions, leading to the challenges in cross-domain image classification. We introduce a simple training heuristic, Representation Self-Challenging (RSC), that significantly improves the generalization of CNN to the out-of-domain data. RSC iteratively challenges (discards) the dominant features activated on the training data, and forces the network to activate remaining features that correlates with labels. This process appears to activate feature representations applicable to out-of-domain data without prior knowledge of new domain and without learning extra network parameters. We present theoretical properties and conditions of RSC for improving cross-domain generalization. The experiments endorse the simple, effective and architecture-agnostic nature of our RSC method.},

  month         = mar,
  abstract      = {Federated learning allows distributed medical institutions to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model with privacy protection. While at clinical deployment, the models trained in federated learning can still suffer from performance drop when applied to completely unseen hospitals outside the federation. In this paper, we point out and solve a novel problem setting of federated domain generalization (FedDG), which aims to learn a federated model from multiple distributed source domains such that it can directly generalize to unseen target domains. We present a novel approach, named as Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space (ELCFS), for this problem by enabling each client to exploit multi-source data distributions under the challenging constraint of data decentralization. Our approach transmits the distribution information across clients in a privacy-protecting way through an effective continuous frequency space interpolation mechanism. With the transferred multi-source distributions, we further carefully design a boundary-oriented episodic learning paradigm to expose the local learning to domain distribution shifts and particularly meet the challenges of model generalization in medical image segmentation scenario. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with superior performance over state-of-the-arts and in-depth ablation experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks.

  abstract      = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing training times by up to 99% compared to the baselines.},

  abstract      = {Automated detection of abnormalities in data has been studied in research area in recent years because of its diverse applications in practice including video surveillance, industrial damage detection and network intrusion detection. However, building an effective anomaly detection system is a non-trivial task since it requires to tackle challenging issues of the shortage of annotated data, inability of defining anomaly objects explicitly and the expensive cost of feature engineering procedure. Unlike existing appoaches which only partially solve these problems, we develop a unique framework to cope the problems above simultaneously. Instead of hanlding with ambiguous definition of anomaly objects, we propose to work with regular patterns whose unlabeled data is abundant and usually easy to collect in practice. This allows our system to be trained completely in an unsupervised procedure and liberate us from the need for costly data annotation. By learning generative model that capture the normality distribution in data, we can isolate abnormal data points that result in low normality scores (high abnormality scores). Moreover, by leverage on the power of generative networks, i.e. energy-based models, we are also able to learn the feature representation automatically rather than replying on hand-crafted features that have been dominating anomaly detection research over many decades. We demonstrate our proposal on the specific application of video anomaly detection and the experimental results indicate that our method performs better than baselines and are comparable with state-of-the-art methods in many benchmark video anomaly detection datasets.},
