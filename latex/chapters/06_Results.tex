\chapter{Results}
This is a summary of the results from Chapter \ref{ch:identifying_best_performers} and \ref{ch:implementing_an_expert_system}.

\section{Best Performers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item From Data Analysis
    \item Map to Theory/ Literature Review and Structures of Algorithms
\end{itemize}

% 2. If there is a correlation, identify possible reasons, why some algos perform better on certain anomaly types
%A significant correlation shows that the detection capabilities depend on the anomaly type to detect and the method algorithms use to detect it. Following this finding we can formulate hypotheses on what characteristics are beneficial for detecting certain anomaly types. 
% 3. dive deeper and analyze the differences in characteristics and performance within one group + Proof that the these algo characteristics are the reason for their performance benefit (how?).
%Since there are also structural differences between algortihms within one family, a deeper dive into each family and the including algorithms is performed. Potential deviations in performance within one family could rule out unnecessary characteristics and ultimately identify beneficial characteristics. A performance comparison between similar algorithms that differ in the identified characteristic could help to proof that the performance increase is due to this certain characteristic.
