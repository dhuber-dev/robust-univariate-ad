\chapter{Conclusion}
% Summary of Findings
\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithms should only be evaluated on the discovered anomaly type and compared within their family to solve the problem of comparability
    \item We suggest the mapping of algorithm families to anomaly types as a solution to the problem of performance comparison presented by Braei et al. \cite{Braei2020}.
    \item The better solution is different algorithms for different anomaly types -> expert system
    \item only tested on GutenTAG, might be biased, good to test on other dataset that offers unique anomalies
    \item Ergebnisse auch sehr parameter abh√§ngig, besonders bei sensitiven algorithmen
    \item Weg von time series, was gibts noch
    % Future Work
    \item Extend to supervised, another prefilter if labels are available
    including potential extensions to more complex multivariate settings
    model compression for real-time applications
